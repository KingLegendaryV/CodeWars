`CodeWars: The Final Battle`


I messed up one day and deleted some repositories that I feel are key to my journey as a software engineer.  In a misguided attempt to revamp my github pageI got rid of something that showcases the most important part of learning any new thing: the struggle.

This repo is a collection of simple codewars that were hard as hell for me as I tried to practice js and dive deeper into the language.  This will be the place that I push challenges from now on
